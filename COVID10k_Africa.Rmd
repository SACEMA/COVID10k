## Summary

According to the WHO Situation reports (SITREPs) of 24 March 2020, 45 out of 56 African countries have reported at least one case of COVID-19 [@WHOSR]. Here we estimate the timing for the first 1 000 (1K) and first 10 000 (10K) COVID-19 cases for those countries. Based on current trends, we find almost all African countries are likely to pass 1K reported cases by 1 May, and 10K within another few weeks (Figure and Table 1); alarmingly, these are largely synchronised continent-wide, and real burdens are certainly higher than reports. This calls for urgent action across Africa.

New containment measures, e.g. increased testing, contact tracing, isolation of cases, and quarantine of contacts are likely to slow, but not halt, real epidemic growth [@containment]. Increased testing may accelerate the time to reporting these numbers, as improved ascertainment increases the identified fraction of real cases, but should ultimately reduce real overall burden.

These forecasts are only as accurate as the data available in the SITREPs and applicability of global experience to Africa. Lags and missingness in that data tend to delay onset of the 1K and 10K case dates, so the real timing is likely sooner than our estimates for many countries. Additionally, our model is inappropriate for long range forecasts, hence the restricted projections. However, we are currently reproducing the reporting in some countries with advanced epidemics, like South Africa, when assuming $R\approx 2$; for $R\approx 3$ (as suggested for other settings in some recent studies), we forecast all countries to likely have 10K cases by the end of April.

## Methods

We estimate the cumulative reported cases using a branching process model to simulate the epidemic. We assume the epidemic is seeded by cases distributed in time proportionally to the earliest SITREP cases; transmission from those specific cases may have been contained, but we assume other undetected transmission chains persist and eventually lead to detected cases. We assume the epidemics proceed similarly to other regions in the world, and whatever rates of detection and other intervention measures affected the initially reported cases remain constant on a country-by-country basis.

The model is initialized assuming that the epidemic was seeded by the cases represented in the SITREPs. We used the first 25 (or fewer) cases as representative the timing of early seeding. For countries with fewer than 25 cases on 24 March, the projections are made from 25 March. For example, South Africa's last day with fewer than 25 cases is 13 March, so projections are made from 14 March.

Epidemic parameters:

- Each case produces an average of 2 additional cases [@reproductionNumber] (negative binomially distributed offspring distribution with mean 2 and dispersion parameter 0.38 [@dispersionParameter]).
- The average time between the onset of a case and the onset of a subsequent case infected by that case (serial interval) is 4.7 days (log-normally distributed with mean 4.7 and standard deviation 2.9) [@serialInterval].

The model was run 1000 times. The results are summarized using the middle 50\% and 95\% of the distribution for the time to reach the specified number of cases. The estimates specific to South Africa are based on a higher resolution forecast (10x samples) previously used for a national report.

The model was built using the `bpmodels` package in the R statistical programming language [@bpmodels], and using the `data2019nCoV` package for the SITREP data up to report 63 [@data2019nCoV].
