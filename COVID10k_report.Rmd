This report investigates the expected timeframe for the first 1,000 and first 10,000 COVID-19 cases in South Africa, in the absence of additional mitigation efforts. Using a branching process model to simulate the growth of the epidemic, and importation occuring from the 5 March, we find that the cumulative case count is likely to reach 1,000 cases between 28 March and 2 April (95\% range: 25 March - 9 April), and that the cumulative case count is likely to reach 10,000 cases between 11 April and 16 April (95\% range: 7 April - 25 April). Containment measures, including testing, contact tracing, isolation of cases, and quarantine of contacts are likely to slow, but not halt, the growth of the epidemic [@containment].

## Assumptions and parameters

The model is initialized assuming that the epidemic was seeded by undetected cases occurring between 5 and 13 March, and makes the following additional assumptions: 

- Any containment or mitigation efforts put into place during the early phase of the epidemic have no impact on undetected cases.
- The fraction of cases detected remains constant and is at least 50\%.
- Each case produces an average of 2 additional cases [@reproductionNumber] (negative binomially distributed offspring distribution with mean 2 and dispersion parameter 0.38 [@dispersionParameter]).
- The average time between the onset of a case and the onset of a subsequent case infected by that case (serial interval) is 4.7 days (log-normally distributed with mean 4.7 and standard deviation 2.9) [@serialInterval].

The model was run 10,000 times and the full distribution of results is presented in the figure. The results are summarized using the middle 50\% and 95\% of the distribution for the time to reach the specified number of cases.

The model was built using the `bpmodels` package in the R statistical programming language [@bpmodels].
